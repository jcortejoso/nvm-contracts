/**
 * @title Agreement Template
 * @author Keyko
 *
 * @dev Implementation of NFT Sales Template
 *
 *      The NFT Sales template supports an scenario where a NFT owner
 *      can sell that asset to a new Owner.
 *      Anyone (consumer/provider/publisher) can use this template in order
 *      to setup an agreement allowing a NFT owner to transfer the asset ownership
 *      after some payment. 
 *      The template is a composite of 3 basic conditions: 
 *      - Lock Payment Condition
 *      - Transfer NFT Condition
 *      - Escrow Reward Condition
 * 
 *      This scenario takes into account royalties for original creators in the secondary market.
 *      Once the agreement is created, the consumer after payment can request the transfer of the NFT
 *      from the current owner for a specific DID.
