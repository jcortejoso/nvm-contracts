/**
 * @title Agreement Template
 * @author Keyko
 *
 * @dev Implementation of NFT Access Template
 *
 *      The NFT Access template is use case specific template.
 *      Anyone (consumer/provider/publisher) can use this template in order
 *      to setup an agreement allowing NFT holders to get access to Nevermined services. 
 *      The template is a composite of 2 basic conditions: 
 *      - NFT Holding Condition
 *      - Access Condition
 * 
 *      Once the agreement is created, the consumer can demonstrate is holding a NFT
 *      for a specific DID. If that's the case the Access condition can be fulfilled
 *      by the asset owner or provider and all the agreement is fulfilled.
 *      This can be used in scenarios where a data or services owner, can allow 
 *      users to get access to exclusive services only when they demonstrate the 
 *      are holding a specific number of NFTs of a DID.
 *      This is very useful in use cases like arts.
