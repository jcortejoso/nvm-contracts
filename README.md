## Get Started

For local development of `nevermined-contracts` you can either use Docker, or setup the development environment on your machine.

### Docker

The simplest way to get started with is using the [Nevermined Tools](https://github.com/keyko-io/nevermined-tools),
a docker compose application to run all the Nevermined stack.

### Local development

As a pre-requisite, you need:

- Node.js
- npm

Note: For MacOS, make sure to have `node@10` installed.

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:keyko-io/nevermined-contracts.git
cd nevermined-contracts/

# install dependencies
npm i

# install RPC client globally
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Compile the solidity contracts:

```bash
npm run compile
```

In a new terminal, launch an Ethereum RPC client, e.g. [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Switch back to your other terminal and deploy the contracts:

```bash
npm run deploy:development

# for redeployment run this instead
npm run clean
npm run compile
npm run deploy:development
```

Upgrade contracts [**optional**]:
```bash
npm run upgrade
```

## Testing

Run tests with `npm run test`, e.g.:

```bash
npm run test -- test/unit/agreements/AgreementStoreManager.Test.js
```

### Code Linting

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint).

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

## Networks

### Testnets

#### Integration Testnet

The contract addresses deployed on Nevermined `Integration` Test Network:

| Contract                          | Version | Address                                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| -                                 | -       | -                                            |


#### Staging Testnet

The contract addresses deployed on Nevermined `Staging` Test Network:

| Contract                          | Version | Address                                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| -                                 | -       | -                                            |



### Mainnets

### Production Mainnet

The contract addresses deployed on `Production` Mainnet:

| Contract                          | Version | Address                                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| -                                 | -       | -                                            |


## Packages

To facilitate the integration of the Ocean Protocol's `keeper-contracts` there are `Python`, `JavaScript` and `Java` packages ready to be integrated. Those libraries include the Smart Contract ABI's.
Using these packages helps to avoid compiling the Smart Contracts and copying the ABI's manually to your project. In that way the integration is cleaner and easier.
The packages provided currently are:

* JavaScript `npm` package - As part of the [@keyko-io npm organization](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/keyko-io/packages),
  the [npm nevermined-contracts package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keyko-io/nevermined-contracts) provides the ABI's
  to be imported from your `JavaScript` code.
* Python `Pypi` package - The [Pypi nevermined-contracts package](https://pypi.org/project/nevermined-contracts/) provides
  the same ABI's to be used from `Python`.
* Java `Maven` package - The [Maven nevermined-contracts package](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.keyko/nevermined-contracts)
  provides the same ABI's to be used from `Java`.

The packages contains all the content from the `doc/` and `artifacts/` folders.

In `JavaScript` they can be used like this:

Install the `nevermined-contracts` `npm` package.

```bash
npm install @keyko-io/nevermined-contracts
```

Load the ABI of the `OceanToken` contract on the `staging` network:

```javascript
const OceanToken = require('@keyko-io/nevermined-contracts/artifacts/OceanToken.staging.json')
```

The structure of the `artifacts` is:

```json
{
  "abi": "...",
  "bytecode": "0x60806040523...",
  "address": "0x45DE141F8Efc355F1451a102FB6225F1EDd2921d",
  "version": "v0.9.1"
}
```
